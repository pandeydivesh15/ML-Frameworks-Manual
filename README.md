# ML-Frameworks-Manual
##Introduction
This will contain useful commands(or snippets) for Python, along with their meanings and uses. I aim to write the commands/snippets of various frameworks(Numpy, pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, etc).

In the world of various frameworks and libraries, forgetting the correct syntax of any important function seems possible. I have created this repo so that whenever I find any new function/method of any library, I will put that function's sample code here(along with some explanation).
